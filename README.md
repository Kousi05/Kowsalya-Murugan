Abstract

The on-demand food delivery industry has witnessed exponential growth in recent years, driven by factors such as busy lifestyles, increased smartphone penetration, and growing consumer preference for convenience. However, existing food delivery platforms face challenges such as limited restaurant selection, complex interfaces, and inefficient delivery processes.

This project proposes a novel food delivery platform that addresses these shortcomings and provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for both customers and restaurants. The platform will offer a wider variety of restaurants, including local and national chains, and feature an intuitive interface that simplifies the order process. Additionally, the platform will implement an optimized delivery system to ensure timely and efficient order fulfillment.

To further enhance the user experience, the platform will incorporate features such as online order tracking, user reviews and restaurant ratings, loyalty programs, and discount promotions. These features will increase user engagement, foster customer loyalty, and attract new users.

The target market for this food delivery platform includes busy professionals, families, and individuals seeking a convenient way to order food. The platform will initially focus on densely populated urban areas with a high demand for food delivery services.
